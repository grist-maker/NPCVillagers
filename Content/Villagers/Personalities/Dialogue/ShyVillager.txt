"I was hoping we\'d get to talk more today. I\'ve been waiting..."
"I like spending time with you like this. You\'re a lot more... understanding than other people I\'ve known."
"It\'s been a while since I\'ve been so at peace talking to someone... Like I can really just say whatever\'s on my mind freely."
   HighAffinity(3)="Are you happy in such a small, busy town? I mean, I guess it really doesn\'t matter where we are, as long as I\'m with you."
   HighAffinity(4)="I\'m not exactly the kind of person who wants to go get coffee at a cafe together, but I wouldn\'t mind having you over for a cup sometime."
   HighAffinity(5)="Ah, hello again. How has the day been treating you? I look forward to getting to hear your answer to that everyday."
   HighAffinity(6)="You\'re the type of person that can\'t give up on things they\'ve started, aren\'t you? You certainly didn\'t give up on me. I appreciate it."
   MidAffinity(0)="Things are pretty quiet today... I\'m glad we can appreciate that kind of peace."
   MidAffinity(1)="What\'s on your mind today? Not much going on here..."
   MidAffinity(2)="Oh, you want to talk to me? Go ahead, I\'m a good listener."
   MidAffinity(3)="You seem pretty nice... Not everyone takes the time to really listen to those around them."
   MidAffinity(4)="Hm... We\'re pretty similar, aren\'t we? Well, thank you for taking the inititative in talking to me."
   MidAffinity(5)="The weather is nice for a walk today... Care to join me?"
   MidAffinity(6)="I find myself reading a lot lately. Any books you\'d recommend?"
   LowAffinity(0)="I don\'t want to talk... Can\'t you say something?"
   LowAffinity(1)="I don\'t think this conversation is going anywhere...."
   LowAffinity(2)="I\'m not sure we really click..."
   LowAffinity(3)="Why are you so interested in me..?"
   LowAffinity(4)="I\'m not really good at this... Sorry."
   LowAffinity(5)="...Isn\'t there someone else you\'d rather talk to?"
   LowAffinity(6)="Do you really like me..? I thought you hated me."
   HighEnergy(0)="I\'ve got a bit more energy than usual today. I don\'t need to pause at all when I speak!"
   HighEnergy(1)="Today feels... invigorating. Like I\'m capable of just about anything."
   HighEnergy(2)="I feel like I could climb a mountain today... Or at least reach the halfway point."
   HighEnergy(3)="I\'m not much for social gatherings but... If I was, I\'d have the energy to host."
   HighEnergy(4)="The day hasn\'t started to wear on you already, has it? I\'m still feeling wide awake."
   HighEnergy(5)="Hm... Maybe those new pillows I bought really DID make a difference. I figured it was a scam, but maybe this energy is proof I was wrong."
   HighEnergy(6)="Do you feel restless too today? It\'s... a new feeling for me. Not sure I like it yet."
   MidEnergy(0)="Hm... I feel like I\'m starting to tire. Not quite break time yet though. We\'ve got to hang in there a bit longer."
   MidEnergy(1)="I think I feel satisfied with what I\'ve done so far today. But I still have a ways to go before bedtime... In the mood to talk?"
   MidEnergy(2)="Come to wind down a bit with me? It\'s fine, I\'ve been known to have that effect on people..."
   MidEnergy(3)="Maybe I lost track of time... I feel like I\'ve been up for quite a bit already."
   MidEnergy(4)="You still seem like you\'re full of energy... How do you do it? Is it something special you drink, or more of a lifestyle change?"
   MidEnergy(5)="A touch peaceful, with a few decisions along the way... Just the right amount of action for me. Now I\'ll be ready to sleep later."
   MidEnergy(6)="Still in the mood to talk? My social battery\'s running a bit low... But for you, maybe I can make an exception."
   LowEnergy(0)="Too... Tired... For... Words..."
   LowEnergy(1)="I need to rest for now... Please..."
   LowEnergy(2)="Can\'t talk... Brain fried..."
   LowEnergy(3)="...Did you say something? I am hardly conscious..."
   LowEnergy(4)="Recharging. Talk later."
   LowEnergy(5)="I\'m fine... Just let me relax a bit longer..."
   LowEnergy(6)="...Five more minutes..."
   HappyMood(0)="You seem chipper today... I\'m not in a bad mood myself. I bet I could even smile. See?"
   HappyMood(1)="It\'s not a bad day today. Actually, it\'s been quite good... Maybe it\'s the karma I\'ve been saving up?"
   HappyMood(2)="Hey there. Things seem to be going pretty alright for now. Kind of nice, really. Getting to talk to you more is another benefit."
   HappyMood(3)="Surprised to see me in such a good mood? ...Well you didn\'t have to say it like THAT. But I am feeling well."
   HappyMood(4)="Talking seems to come a lot more naturally today... Maybe something changed in the air? Or maybe I just like talking to you."
   HappyMood(5)="So... Do people tend to feel happy and positive like this often? Asking for a friend."
   HappyMood(6)="You know, it\'s important to take breaks to appreciate the small things. I\'ve been doing that all day, and I couldn\'t be happier."
   SadMood(0)="I look gloomy, don\'t I..? It\'s ok... No need to check on me. I\'ll figure it out..."
   SadMood(1)="I\'m...in a bad place emotionally right now. Just leave me to it, I\'ll be fine."
   SadMood(2)="Talking doesn\'t help when I get like this... I need to be alone. That includes from you."
   SadMood(3)="...I don\'t want to be here right now. Can you just leave me alone?"
   SadMood(4)="Hey... You don\'t need to check on me. I\'m an adult, I\'ve been sad before. I can deal with it myself."
   SadMood(5)="I don\'t feel so happy right now. Don\'t let me bring you down too... That will just make me feel worse."
   SadMood(6)="I need to wallow for a bit. Can you let me do that, please? Without you?"
   AngryMood(0)="Can you just back off for a bit? I\'m not in the mood."
   AngryMood(1)="I\'m feeling moody. Don\'t take it personally. Or do, I don\'t care... Sorry, I do care. Just leave me alone for a bit."
   AngryMood(2)="I. Don\'t. Want. To. TALK!"
   AngryMood(3)="Stay out of my way. Please. Just step a bit to the side so I can go cool off."
   AngryMood(4)="I don\'t need to actually tell you to get lost to be alone for a bit, do I?"
   AngryMood(5)="Are you trying to tick me off? I am in a mood. I don\'t think you want to talk to me while I\'m in a mood."
   AngryMood(6)="Oh, wow ok. That\'s great. Just SUPER. Yeah, I\'m sure THIS will work out well..."
   ExcitedMood(0)="I\'m feeling a bit daring. Might even text that guy I went to highschool with... No, not that daring."
   ExcitedMood(1)="Howdy partner. Ah, is that too much? I kinda felt like trying something new..."
   ExcitedMood(2)="Wouldn\'t it be fun to just take to the road on an adventure and never look back, like in the movies? I always dreamed of trying something like that."
   ExcitedMood(3)="I was SO outgoing today. I told the cashier to have a nice day when I picked up my pizza and everything!"
   ExcitedMood(4)="It\'s a new day tomorrow, isn\'t it? Maybe that\'s my chance to switch careers and make my own shop... No, too many people."
   ExcitedMood(5)="When you think about it, there really isn\'t much you can\'t do, is there..? I mean, humans went to the moon... That\'s what they want you to think anyway..."
   ExcitedMood(6)="You know what? Starting today, I am going to be a new person. I am going to go to a party... and I\'ll pretend to like it!"
   ScaredMood(0)="I\'ve been really getting into conspiracy theories lately... Why..? Oh... No reason. No reason at all!"
   ScaredMood(1)="They\'re in the walls... Crawling on my skin... They\'re all around me, closing in... Who? T-termites, what else?"
   ScaredMood(2)="Oooh I hear them rustling... Sneaking through the bushes, climbing in the trees... They know our names... I read an interesting article about them the other day."
   ScaredMood(3)="Ohhh I know I\'m not gonna like this..."
   ScaredMood(4)="Crazy stuff happens in this village... Did you see that flock of crows the other day? That\'s a bad omen..."
   ScaredMood(5)="You can\'t trust him... No, no never again! I know he\'s planning something... He has to be, this never lasts..."
   ScaredMood(6)="Stay back..! I don\'t want to hurt you, but I will!"
   BusyState(0)="..."
   BusyState(1)="Please leave me alone..."
   BusyState(2)="I\'m busy..."
   BusyState(3)="...Can I help you? I\'m doing something right now..."
   BusyState(4)="Can this wait? I\'m still at work..."
   BusyState(5)="I don\'t have time to talk right now..."
   BusyState(6)="Still working..."

   LikedGifts(6)="This is so thoughtful... Did you really come up with this all by yourself? You\'re even more impressive than I thought."

   MiddleGifts(1)="Oh, hey this has a nice weight to it... I like it. Thanks."
   MiddleGifts(2)="Ah... I\'m new to being put on the spot like this. But it\'s cute. I like it."
   MiddleGifts(3)="Nice. Oh, I get to keep it? You won\'t take it back? Promise?"
   MiddleGifts(4)="Hey this is... This is alright. I think I\'ll hang onto it for a while. Thank you."
   MiddleGifts(5)="For me? Really..? It\'s not even bad... Wow. I don\'t know what to say. Thanks."
   MiddleGifts(6)="This is pretty cool... You\'re sure you want me to keep it? Because I will."

   DislikedGifts(6)="...Do you really know me THIS poorly?"
   Coworker(0)=" is pretty nice to me... A bit on the loud side for my tastes, but still cool."
   Coworker(1)=" is a real \"strong silent\" type. Uh... wait. Maybe not \"silent\". They\'re a real \"strong\" type."
   Coworker(2)=" seems pretty focused whenever they\'re at work... I once found them passed out right over there..."
   Coworker(3)=" always makes time to check on how I\'m doing... I don\'t really know what game they\'re playing here."
   Coworker(4)=" and I have worked together for a few years now... We\'re almost friends, right?"
   Coworker(5)="... I still feel like I don\'t know them all that well, but I can always count on them to be on time with their work."
   Coworker(6)=" and you are like twins... Not physically. More like \"emotional\" twins. If you were employed. And actually had a house here."
   HurtCoworker(0)=" and I... Are closer than you\'ll be to anyone in your cruel, lonely life."
