I was hoping we'd get to talk more today. I've been waiting...
I like spending time with you like this. You're a lot more... understanding than other people I've known.
It's been a while since I've been so at peace talking to someone... Like I can really just say whatever's on my mind freely.
Are you happy in such a small, busy town? I mean, I guess it really doesn't matter where we are, as long as I'm with you.
I'm not exactly the kind of person who wants to go get coffee at a cafe together, but I wouldn't mind having you over for a cup sometime.
Ah, hello again. How has the day been treating you? I look forward to getting to hear your answer to that everyday.
You're the type of person that can't give up on things they've started, aren't you? You certainly didn't give up on me. I appreciate it.
MidAffinity
Things are pretty quiet today... I'm glad we can appreciate that kind of peace.
What's on your mind today? Not much going on here...
Oh, you want to talk to me? Go ahead, I'm a good listener.
You seem pretty nice... Not everyone takes the time to really listen to those around them.
Hm... We're pretty similar, aren't we? Well, thank you for taking the inititative in talking to me.
The weather is nice for a walk today... Care to join me?
I find myself reading a lot lately. Any books you'd recommend?
LowAffinity
I don't want to talk... Can't you say something?
I don't think this conversation is going anywhere....
"I'm not sure we really click...
Why are you so interested in me..?
I'm not really good at this... Sorry.
...Isn't there someone else you'd rather talk to?
Do you really like me..? I thought you hated me.
HighEnergy
I've got a bit more energy than usual today. I don't need to pause at all when I speak!
Today feels... invigorating. Like I'm capable of just about anything.
I feel like I could climb a mountain today... Or at least reach the halfway point.
I'm not much for social gatherings but... If I was, I'd have the energy to host.
The day hasn't started to wear on you already, has it? I'm still feeling wide awake.
Hm... Maybe those new pillows I bought really DID make a difference. I figured it was a scam, but maybe this energy is proof I was wrong.
Do you feel restless too today? It's... a new feeling for me. Not sure I like it yet.
MidEnergy
Hm... I feel like I'm starting to tire. Not quite break time yet though. We've got to hang in there a bit longer.
I think I feel satisfied with what I've done so far today. But I still have a ways to go before bedtime... In the mood to talk?
Come to wind down a bit with me? It's fine, I've been known to have that effect on people...
Maybe I lost track of time... I feel like I've been up for quite a bit already.
You still seem like you're full of energy... How do you do it? Is it something special you drink, or more of a lifestyle change?
A touch peaceful, with a few decisions along the way... Just the right amount of action for me. Now I'll be ready to sleep later.
Still in the mood to talk? My social battery's running a bit low... But for you, maybe I can make an exception.
LowEnergy
Too... Tired... For... Words...
I need to rest for now... Please...
Can't talk... Brain fried...
...Did you say something? I am hardly conscious...
Recharging. Talk later.
I'm fine... Just let me relax a bit longer...
...Five more minutes...
HappyMood
You seem chipper today... I'm not in a bad mood myself. I bet I could even smile. See?
It's not a bad day today. Actually, it's been quite good... Maybe it's the karma I've been saving up?
Hey there. Things seem to be going pretty alright for now. Kind of nice, really. Getting to talk to you more is another benefit.
Surprised to see me in such a good mood? ...Well you didn't have to say it like THAT. But I am feeling well.
Talking seems to come a lot more naturally today... Maybe something changed in the air? Or maybe I just like talking to you.
So... Do people tend to feel happy and positive like this often? Asking for a friend.
You know, it's important to take breaks to appreciate the small things. I've been doing that all day, and I couldn't be happier.
SadMood
I look gloomy, don't I..? It's ok... No need to check on me. I'll figure it out...
I'm...in a bad place emotionally right now. Just leave me to it, I'll be fine.
Talking doesn't help when I get like this... I need to be alone. That includes from you.
...I don't want to be here right now. Can you just leave me alone?
Hey... You don't need to check on me. I'm an adult, I've been sad before. I can deal with it myself.
I don't feel so happy right now. Don't let me bring you down too... That will just make me feel worse.
I need to wallow for a bit. Can you let me do that, please? Without you?
AngryMood
Can you just back off for a bit? I'm not in the mood.
I'm feeling moody. Don't take it personally. Or do, I don't care... Sorry, I do care. Just leave me alone for a bit.
I. Don't. Want. To. TALK!
Stay out of my way. Please. Just step a bit to the side so I can go cool off.
I don't need to actually tell you to get lost to be alone for a bit, do I?
Are you trying to tick me off? I am in a mood. I don't think you want to talk to me while I'm in a mood.
Oh, wow ok. That's great. Just SUPER. Yeah, I'm sure THIS will work out well...
ExcitedMood
I'm feeling a bit daring. Might even text that guy I went to highschool with... No, not that daring.
Howdy partner. Ah, is that too much? I kinda felt like trying something new...
Wouldn't it be fun to just take to the road on an adventure and never look back, like in the movies? I always dreamed of trying something like that.
I was SO outgoing today. I told the cashier to have a nice day when I picked up my pizza and everything!
It's a new day tomorrow, isn't it? Maybe that's my chance to switch careers and make my own shop... No, too many people.
When you think about it, there really isn't much you can't do, is there..? I mean, humans went to the moon... That's what they want you to think anyway...
You know what? Starting today, I am going to be a new person. I am going to go to a party... and I'll pretend to like it!
ScaredMood
I've been really getting into conspiracy theories lately... Why..? Oh... No reason. No reason at all!
They're in the walls... Crawling on my skin... They're all around me, closing in... Who? T-termites, what else?
Oooh I hear them rustling... Sneaking through the bushes, climbing in the trees... They know our names... I read an interesting article about them the other day.
Ohhh I know I'm not gonna like this...
Crazy stuff happens in this village... Did you see that flock of crows the other day? That's a bad omen...
You can't trust him... No, no never again! I know he's planning something... He has to be, this never lasts...
Stay back..! I don't want to hurt you, but I will!
BusyState
...
Please leave me alone...
I'm busy...
...Can I help you? I'm doing something right now...
Can this wait? I'm still at work...
I don't have time to talk right now...
Still working...
HurtReactions
What the?! Why?
That hurt! Please stop!
Stay away from me!
What did I do?!
Try to calm down!
You're scaring me!
Did I do something wrong?
LikedGifts
Oh this... This is really nice. Are you sure you want to give it to me? No strings attached? Thank you!
This is very high quality... You must have impeccable taste. I can hardly bring myself to accept it.
Ah, wait. Is this really for me..? I had my eye on this for a while... How did you know?
I've never received something so perfect... I will cherish it forever. Thank you so much...
This object... It speaks to me. I will gladly take it, though I don't know how on Earth you thought me worthy.
I don't think I've ever been so happy... I love it., and I usually hate surprises. Thank you.
This is so thoughtful... Did you really come up with this all by yourself? You're even more impressive than I thought.
MiddleGifts
Oh, a gift..? I don't get a ton of those... Thanks for making my day a bit nicer.
Oh, hey this has a nice weight to it... I like it. Thanks.
Ah... I'm new to being put on the spot like this. But it's cute. I like it.
Nice. Oh, I get to keep it? You won't take it back? Promise?
Hey this is... This is alright. I think I'll hang onto it for a while. Thank you.
For me? Really..? It's not even bad... Wow. I don\'t know what to say. Thanks.
This is pretty cool... You're sure you want me to keep it? Because I will.
DislikedGifts
Thanks, I hate it.
...Would you like to try that again?
I don't think I really "get" this...
I didn't know you thought of me that way... How disappointing.
Ah, figures. I did get bad vibes from you today...
I'm really not a fan of this kind of thing...
...Do you really know me THIS poorly?
Coworker
 is pretty nice to me... A bit on the loud side for my tastes, but still cool.
 is a real "strong silent" type. Uh... wait. Maybe not "silent". They're a real "strong" type.
 seems pretty focused whenever they're at work... I once found them passed out right over there...
 always makes time to check on how I'm doing... I don't really know what game they're playing here.
 and I have worked together for a few years now... We're almost friends, right?
... I still feel like I don't know them all that well, but I can always count on them to be on time with their work.
 and you are like twins... Not physically. More like "emotional" twins. If you were employed. And actually had a house here.
HurtCoworker
 and I... Are closer than you'll be to anyone in your cruel, lonely life.
 is one of the people I trust most... I would always take their side over yours.
 works at the same place I do, and has always made me feel welcome... You're nothing in my eyes after what you did.
 has been nothing but understanding of my... unique personality. Why can't you be more understanding of theirs..?
's not over what you did... And I'm not either. Don't talk to me anymore...
 wasn't so happy with how you acted back there... Do you use violence for all your problems?
... Was really hurt by what you did. Physically AND emotionally... I don't think I like your vibes...
