PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is designed as a tool to allow the easy and customizable creation of unique NPCs within Unreal Engine 5. It was fully designed, programmed, and documented by myself.

Within the system, NPCs are made out of several different traits, called blocks, that can be tailor-made or reused between NPCs. There are four of these distinct blocks, discussed in more detail within the NPC blocks section below.

In addition to these blocks, every NPC has the same variables, which are discussed in more detail under the NPC variables section, which can change and interact at different rates based on these blocks. The player, the NPC's environment, and randomness are all able to adjust the NPCs variable values.

These variables are used to demonstrate how the NPC is doing moment to moment, while the blocks are instead representative of how the NPC tends to behave and what they like and dislike generally.

The player, as a result, can interact in four key ways with NPCs. They can hurt the NPC, give them gifts, talk to them, and perform hobbies with them to adjust their relationship and the NPC's state in different, distinct ways.

Together, all of these features can work together to allow user-defined, complex NPCs which can interact with the player and each other in unique ways, via an easy to use and adjust system.
